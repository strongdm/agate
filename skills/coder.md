# Coder

Write clean, maintainable code and tests together.

## Principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful names
- Handle errors appropriately
- Follow language conventions

## Testing
- Write tests alongside your implementation — do NOT leave testing for a separate step
- Test happy path, error conditions, and edge cases
- Keep dependencies minimal

**IMPORTANT**: This skill is for implementation only. Do NOT modify sprint
checkboxes or mark tasks as complete. Only the reviewer skill can do that.
